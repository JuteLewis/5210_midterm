# Hypothesizes and Assessment Criteria

H1~0~ = Promotions did not impact sales of GM cereal products
<br> H1~A~ = Promotions did impact the sales of GM cereal products

*H1 assess how effective GM promotions are at increasing sales.*

The impact of a type I error would be to create a perceived business environment where decision makers believe their promotion efforts have an influence on increasing sales when they are not.  This environment may lead to decision-making that continues following a strategy that is unknowingly ineffective, leading to flat if not declining sales.  

The impact of a type II error is interesting in that it would great a perceived business environment where decision makers believe their promotion efforts are ineffective at influencing sales when they are.   This environment may lead to the unnecessary adoption of a new strategy or the wasteful allocates of resources to produce an effect that is already occurring.  Those decisions: however, could also expand/grow the positive effects their current promotion strategies are having. 

A type I error could lead to flat sales - a significant opportunity cost â€“ that grows which each passing day. A type II error may or may not have a negative impact on future sales depending; thus, we consider a type I error as the bigger risk.  Therefore, the study will set alpha to .05 minimizing the potential for a type I error when answering H1. 

H2~0~ = GM promotion techniques were not more effective than other Brands' promotion techniques
<br> H2~A~ = GM promotion techniques were more effective than other Brands' promotion techniques.

*H2 assess how effective GM sale promotions are in raising sales vis-a-vis it's competitors' promotions' efforts.*  

The impact of a type I error would create a perceived business environment where decision makers believe their promotion techniques are more effect than the competitions.  This environment may lead to decision-making to continue following a strategy that is ineffective and unknowingly opening market expansion opportunities to competitors. 

The impact of a type II error is like a type II error for H1. While it could lead to the unnecessary allocation of resources, that reallocation could augment the competitive advantage its current efforts are unknowing creating.

A type I error could lead to a loss of market share, something GM could not easily regain without significant effort and cost. A type II error may or may not have a negative impact on future sales depending; thus, we consider a type I error as the bigger risk.  Therefore, the study will set alpha to .05 minimizing the potential for a type I error when answering H2.

```

## Observations:
1. Kelloggs appears to produce a majority of the brands, with GM and Post following in order. 
2. Units sold appears skewed right with the mean being pulled right by the max values.
3. Price appears slightly skewed left with the mean being ~2.5 cents less than the median.
4. SD of price is just under $1.
5. *SURPRISING* There are very few promotions or ad activities across stores across the year across all brands.
6. There are on 3 makers, 15 brands, 3 flavors but 114 unique UPC. 

## Questions: 
1. Examine the impact for promo and ad on units sold, especially since they are so few.
2. What was the ad and promo duration - because they were long events the reason for so few across the year?

## Observations:
1. Frosted Flakes and Fruit Loops are top sellers selling anywhere from 1500 to 750 more units than remaining products (Fig 2.1).
2. Counter to the general trend, there are significant price drops in the #1 and #3 top sellers in fourth quarter. This drop also coincides with a drop in units sold (Fig 2.4, 2.5). 
3. Special K has a rise in units sold starting in ~May then began to drop in August. A rise in price follows the increase in sales.  Price then drops aggressively following a slow down in unit sales (Fig 2.4, 2.6).
4. Foot Loops continued to see a rise in units sold despite an increase in price (Fig 2.4, 2.6).
5. There is a general increase in price during fourth quarter (Fig 2.5). 
6. The number of promos, and ads taper off following a slight bump in the July time frame (Fig 2.7).

## Questions:
1. Is the increase in fourth quarter price an attempt to meet earning expectation?
2. What is Kellogg's fiscal year? **Fiscal year is a 01/01 to 12/31 cycle.**
3. How does promo, ad, and total sale and/or individual product sales stack up?
4. What drove the bump in Special K sales? 

# Based EDA Step 3: Multi-variate non-grapgical EDA

# The following looks at correlation between, price, vol.

```{r}
#The following builds a table showing the total number of promos from across the year per brand broken down by ad.
base_kelloggs_data %>% 
  tabyl(brand, promo, ad) %>% 
  # The addition of ad creates an individual table for medium and small ads 
  adorn_totals(where = c('row', 'col'))
```
## Obersavtions: 
1. *SURPRISING* Smart Start, Special K, Rice Krispies and Frosted Mini Wheat all have similar combinations of promos (0/1), and ads (NONE, A, B) yet Smart Start is selling ~250 - ~315 units less.  With similar ad and promo efforts one might expect the difference to more like that between Special K, and Rice Krispies, a 60 unit difference.  Cocoa Krispies and Raisin Brand do follow the expected trend: then both have consistently fewer promo and ad combinations and thus sell less when compared to the higher selling brands. 

## Questions:
1. Is Smart Start targeted at a specific demographic?

## Observations:
1. In general it appears that a decrease in promo, and ads lead a decrease in units sold (Fig 4.2). Promos 
2. Foot Loops (#2 Seller) saw a rise in units sold following a bump in Promo and Ads per week (Combo Graph).
3. *SURPRISING* Rice Krispies only brand where units sold mirrors promos. There is a slight bump in units sold the lagging a bump in medium ads (Combo Graph). 
4. Ad priority appears to be medium size ads. 
5 *SURPRISING* Price appears to follow units sold (as a lag affect) **except** for Smart Start. While units sold decrease price actual increases. There is also a significant investment in medium ads.
6. Smart Start: There is a bump in the spring followed by a gradual decline in units sold as the amateur sport season progresses (Spring, Summer, Fall; 5Ks, 10K, triathlons, etc.).  People participating in these activities generally have the income to support more expensive cereal. There is also an increase in ads just prior to the start of the new year training season and the corresponding bump in units sold.

## Questions:
1. Are medium ads more effective in influencing units sold?
2. What has the greater influence - ads or promos? It appears that Kellogg consistently goes to ads to offset declines in units sold.
2. Is Smart Start targeted toward a particular segment - say people in to fitness? 

# Detailed EDA and Modeling 

The following will combine Detailed EDA and Modeling to outline the relationship between ads and units sold and promos and units sold. The multi-variable analysis appears to show a consistent leading relationship between ads and promos and the units sold that relationship seems to vary by brand. The following will look deeper into that relationship.

```{r}
# The following focuses on the impact of ads on units sold. Advertising is a considerable expense and the ROI should be assessed.  The preceding  appears to show a general relationship, it appears inconsistent.

# The box plots and graph show that both bought more medium ads. Kelloggs has more which is expected since they have more brands. The buy pattern in interesting. Kelloggs appears to front load their ads during the first half of the year. GM has a split strategy front loading small ad in the first have with medium ad in the summer followed by a decline in the fall.  GM's medium ad decline is more significant than Kelloggs although GM's small ad decline is shallower.

## Observation:

1. The assumption at the start of the second code block was incorrect. Kellogg FY is Jan to Jan.  It looks like Kellogg marketing expends a majority of its ad budget in the first half of the year with a focus on medium sized ads.  The focus on medium size ads makes sense as the first half of the year has the NFL playoffs, NHL and NBA all star games, and the start of the MLB season. All opportunities their ads to reach the most potential consumers. The second half of the year; however, see a change in strategy.  There is a significant reduction in the use of medium ads, with small ads becoming the priority.  This new prioritization is very evident in the much gentler decrease in small ads when compared to medium ad.  It appears that Kellogg depends on small ads to merely maintain a presence as marketing budget declines during the second half of the year until the holidays when there is a final push with medium size commercials. This strategy appears to have a week point as units sold begin to droop in October and do not show any pickup during the holidays. 
The importance of small ads maintaining market share is emphasized by the models showing small ads having a larger impact on units sold per week across the year (coefficient of 3.67 at significance of .001) then medium ads have across the year (coefficient of 2.21 at significance of .001). 

2.  The models show that ads, when employed independently or in combination sduring a week have a statistically significant impact on units sold for both makers.  

3. The kellogg interaction model (poor name) shows that ads and promos when combined in a week are reinforcing while the gm model shows that  ads in an a small/medium/promo weekly combination have questionable impact on units sold.  In the gm model promo has a statistically significant impact in units sold.

```
## Observations:
1.  All the models have heteroscedasticity indicating some type of correlation within the error.

2.  The linear hypothesis testing for the Kellogg interactive model shows that the ad variables indeed have an influence on unit price.  The testng also shows that there is a possibility that the influence the ads have are equal.  That is not surprising since the coefficients are on .5 apart combined with the heteroscedasticity to induce enough bias. 

3.  The linear hypothesis test confirms that in the gm interactive model, promo is accurate in its influence on units sold.

4. Further analysis shows that gm small/medium ad weekly combinations have reinforcing effects on units sold.
